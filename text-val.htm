<p>
  All monumental Thracian tombs consist of stone-built burial chambers covered
  by large earthen mounds. The burial chambers themselves are either rectangular
  or round but show a wide variety of particular forms so that no two Thracian
  tombs are exactly the same. The actual diversity of the tombs depends on the
  type of their roofing. The roofing of tombs with a rectangular plan can
  consist of flat stone slabs, a pitched or truncated roof of counterpoised
  slabs, and different shapes of corbelled vaults or domes. This range of
  chamber forms is in contrast to the Macedonian type of elite tomb, which is
  also present in Thrace on the region&rsquo;s interior as well as along the
  western Black Sea and northern Aegean coasts. Unlike the tombs of Thracian
  elites, those of aristocratic Macedonians are characterized by specific,
  clearly expressed repeating elements. A particularly well-represented Thracian
  tomb type, however, is that with a round plan and corbelled dome, which is the
  so-called tholos type that predominantly spread in the territory of the
  Odrysian kingdom. Any painted or sculpted decoration in a tomb is accordingly
  adapted to the shape of its walls and ceiling.
</p>
<p>
  The earliest monumental funerary structures in Thrace were the dolmens.
  Dolmens have been attested in the southeastern part of the Balkan peninsula in
  the territory of the later Odrysian kingdom. One of these dolmens next to the
  village of Golyam Dervent has a relief decoration on the facade of its
  antechamber that consists of spirals symbolizing the constant renewal of
  nature and a hope for rebirth. The same idea is present in the decoration of
  monumental tombs in the next centuries but is instead expressed by rich
  figural imagery.
</p>
<p>
  Preceding this later development in tomb decoration, the built chamber tombs
  had red or white-painted walls or decorations that either imitated elements of
  the Greek architectural orders or displayed symbols associated with
  eschatological ideas (e.g. at the Ruzhica tomb). The white colour was used in
  several monumental chamber tombs in the interior of Thrace(e.g. the Vetren,
  Shushmanetz, Helvetia, and Dolno Izvorovo tombs). We may assume that the
  Thracians associated the white color with death as the Greeks did. For
  example, the antechamber of the tomb in Maglizh is painted completely in white
  while the burial chamber is decorated with images of armour. The
  antechamber&rsquo;s white walls might then represent the cold liminal
  threshold to theafterworld, which the deceased reaches after a long journey
  along the dark road of death symbolized by the dromos. With its warrior
  imagery, the burial chamber&rsquo;s decoration could then indicate the
  deceased&rsquo;s entrance into an afterlife that saw him relive his glorious
  military career.
</p>
<p>
  The red colour also has strong symbolic resonance because of its association
  with blood. The interiors of some cist graves in the necropoleis of the Greek
  colonies on the Black Sea coast, such as Apollonia (Sozopol) and Messambria
  (Nessebar), are completely colored in red. At the same time, some monumental
  chamber tombs in central Thrace have facades painted in red, like the Kazanlak
  and probably Maglizh tombs.
</p>
<p>
  As for the motifs of Thracian tombs&rsquo; painted decoration, non-figural
  motifs include elements copied from the Greek architectural orders. Most
  commonly these elements are those used to accent walls like plinth, orthostats
  and friezes. The Sarafova Mogila tomb (Kran II, Dolno Lukovo) perhaps best
  exemplifies these non-figural structural motifs. The mouldings, either
  rendered in relief in stucco or painted, are often used and create a
  spectacular decorative effect when richly painted in multiple colors.
  Mouldings and bands are only painted when the overall decoration is simpler,
  like in the tombs at the village of Kaloyanovo (Sliven region), in the
  Filipovo district in Plovdiv, and at the village of Ruec. The Greek
  architectural orders are used liberally at some of the largest Thracian tombs
  as well. In these examples, the facades are marked by Doric or Ionic frames
  sometimes accompanied by pilasters and pediments. The tomb with the richest
  fa&ccedil;ade is under Zhaba mogila near the town of Strelcha. The
  fa&ccedil;ade bears painted relief images of lionesses, antefixes with Gorgon
  heads, and anthemions. Around the entrance of the tomb is still preserved an
  Ionic frame with mouldings. Acroteria were included in the decoration of the
  Ostrusha tomb and the Tomb with the Karyatids at the village of Sveshtari.
  Impressive pediments crowned the entrances of the Shushmanetz tomb and the
  tomb under Chetinyova mogila at Starosel. The fa&ccedil;ade of a tomb
  discovered near the village of Smjadovo (now removed to the Regional museum of
  history of Shumen) is unique. The fa&ccedil;ade is formed by several blocks in
  a completely different way than is typical in the Greek orders. Two pillars
  imitating Ionic columns flank the tomb&rsquo;s corbelled entrance and support
  a heavy lintel engraved with a commemorative inscription and, above the center
  of the lintel, a rounded crowning block bearing an engraved palmette. This
  fa&ccedil;ade is remarkable because of its particularly free imitation of
  Greek architectural elements, showing a specific harmonious design in
  accordance with local Thracian cultural specificity.
</p>
<p>
  Greek architectural elements are utilized in a variety of ways in the interior
  decoration of Thracian tombs as well. In the Shushmanetz tomb, engaged columns
  surround the tomb&rsquo;s round burial chamber while the dome is supported by
  a central heavy column. A similar column with a pseudo-Ionic capital supports
  the antechamber&rsquo;s vaulted ceiling. Most impressive is the approach to
  the tomb under Chetinyova mogila in Starosel, which is dated to the mid-4th
  century BC. The approach begins with a wide staircase that turns into a ramp
  leading to the antechamber&rsquo;s entrance. On both sides of the transition
  between the staircase and the ramp are platforms preceded by several steps.
  There is no doubt that the entire architectural composition had a special cult
  function; the prothesis (laying in state) of the deceased quite likely took
  place there. Commemorative rituals would have been performed on both
  platforms. The representative character of the tomb&rsquo;s architecture is
  also well presented in the burial chamber, where the built-in Doric order is
  highlighted by canonic red, blue, and white coloring.
</p>
<p>
  The most developed example of relief work in a tomb interior is on display in
  the Caryatid tomb, which dates to the second quarter of the 3rd century BC.
  The tomb&rsquo;s plan is asymmetrical as a result of an added side chamber.
  The design of the burial chamber contains all three Greek orders. The Doric
  order is predominant and represented by four engaged Doric columns surmounted
  by triglyphs and metopes. They in turn carry an Ionic cornice. The Corinthian
  order is represented by one column that is centrally positioned opposite the
  entrance in the freeze above the orthostats. In the same frieze, ten caryatids
  presented in high relief support the entablature with their hands and heads.
  There are two funerary beds in the chamber, one of which was initially hidden
  in an aediculaclosed with a three-winged door. The Corinthian column and four
  of the caryatids are placed in the space behind this door and so mark the most
  sacred space in the tomb. Essentially, the funerary chamber&apos;s plan
  imitates a hypaethral temple organized around an inner sanctum (the aedicula)
  set in a peribolos. A scene above the four central caryatids shows eight
  figures. The main image is presumably a &ldquo;scene of heroization:&rdquo; a
  horseman is being wreathed by a woman, probably а goddess. Besides the
  Sveshtari tomb&rsquo;s archaism (expressed in the caryatid figures) and loose
  adaptation of Greek architectural elements, the decoration on the tomb&rsquo;s
  interior is strongly characteristic of the artistic styles and ideals of the
  early Hellenistic period.
</p>
<p>
  Each monumental Thracian tomb is not only stylistically different from the
  others but differs also in iconographic conception. A tomb particularly
  well-known for the iconography of its decoration is the Ostrusha tumulus,
  which dates to 330 -310 BC and is located a couple of kilometers from the town
  of Shipka. The tomb is a complex of rooms arranged around a central burial
  chamber. This chamber is made of two monolithic blocks shaped in the form of a
  sarcophagus with an entrance in its southern long wall. A carved burial bed
  with relief decoration lies next to the northern wall. The ceiling is
  decorated with painted coffers arranged in an orthogonal pattern. The coffers
  differ in dimensions and outlines (square, triangular and one central circular
  coffer). While painted scenes are no longer extant in half of the coffers,
  images of maenads and satyrs as well as of characters from the life of
  Achilles according to Homer&apos;s narrative and Aeschylus&apos; lost
  tragedies are preserved in the other half. Of particular interest for the
  history of Greek iconography is the image of Achilles&rsquo; mother Thetis
  sitting in front of the second set of weapons forged for him by Hephaestus, a
  symbol of both his glory and death. Other coffers show images of the Nereids,
  Thetis&apos; sisters, who brought Achilles these weapons. Other gods and
  heroes who appear in the coffered ceiling of the Ostrusha tomb are Cybele
  riding а lion, Silenus on the back of a donkey, Bellerophon killing the
  Chimera, and the Sirens, which are closely related to death and the
  soul&rsquo;s journey after it.
</p>
<p>
  Chronologically next are two other tombs at Kazanlak and the village of
  Alexandrovo. Both of them have round burial chambers with beehive domes. The
  painted decoration of these domes follows the principles of the Greek orders
  but are adjusted for the domes&rsquo; beehive shape. This decorative
  adjustment is specific to Thracian tombs and is not attested elsewhere in the
  ancient Mediterranean. In the Kazanlak tomb, the lower portion of the
  antechamber&rsquo;s walls has structural relief decoration in the form of a
  plinth, orthostats, and a frieze, after which the wall is painted red. Above
  are several friezes that imitate entablature bands: fascia, an astragalus, an
  Ionic cyma (egg-and-dart), and a Lesbian cyma (cyma recta) in blue and yellow
  on a red background. These friezes are followed by another band with a floral
  scroll on a black background that is topped by a Lesbian cyma, dentils, and an
  Ionic cyma. The wall&rsquo;s decoration ends with images of military scenes in
  which Thracian and Macedonian soldiers take part. In the burial chamber, the
  lower part of the wall is similarly decorated in a structural style with a
  plinth, orthostats in white, a frieze, a red wall, and above that a painted
  architrave. The upper part of the architrave is occupied by a Lesbian cyma
  followed by the main figural frieze. Above the figural frieze run a red line,
  an Ionic cornice, and dentils. Next is an astragalus and a cornice ending with
  a sima, on the edge of which are depicted lion heads.
</p>
<p>
  At the center of the main figural frieze are representations of the man and
  woman who owned the tomb. They are seated in front of a low table on which are
  various dishes and foods. The man is wearing a white chiton with short sleeves
  and a rich brown-ochre himation. In his right hand he holds a silver deep
  phiale, and he stretches out his left hand to take the hand of his wife. She
  in turn sits on a richly decorated throne with her head slightly bowed and
  covered with a transparent veil. She is dressed in a white chiton and wrapped
  in a brown himation. Her image follows the Classical type of the matron of the
  kind represented on Athenian funerary stelae, in association with the
  iconographic type of Penelope. Next to the couple is the image of a tall woman
  who presents them a plate of grapes and pomegranates, the fruits of the
  chthonic gods Hades and Dionysus. Because of her height and central position
  in the composition, this woman cannot be a simple maid, although she does not
  wear any jeweley. Instead, she is likely a goddess, presumably the Mother
  Goddess, the primordial divinity and Mistress of life and death. Above the
  cornice that crowns the main figural frieze is another frieze showing a
  chariot race. In each chariot the driver wears a long chiton. The style of
  painting in the Kazanlak tomb is distinguished by an elegant line, elongated
  proportions, and many shades of color.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="white-space: pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Alexandrovo tomb, the
  lower part of the round burial chamber&rsquo;s wall is decorated with the
  scene of a feast in which three men are served by a cup-bearers. A frieze with
  hunting scenes runs around the beehive vault. The images of boar and deer
  hunts, which are traditionally associated with the life of the elites, are
  influenced by the iconography of Persian royal and aristocratic hunting. In
  Thrace, this type of scene is further developed on toreutics and other
  precious metal objects. Next to the tomb of Mal-tepe in Mezek was even
  discovered a bronze statue of a wounded boar, which was originally part of a
  large statuary group. For Thracian elites, hunting was perceived not only as a
  pleasure but also as a way to keep fit in peacetime. The practice was also
  part of the training of young aristocrats to become ideal members of Odrysian
  elite society.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="white-space: pre">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In sum, Thracian monumental
  tombs reflect new trends in rulers&apos; self-representation that were
  developed and maintained by the elites across the eastern Mediterranean in the
  Hellenistic period and were inspired by Persian royal iconography. The direct
  clash between Persia and Greece, Alexander the Great&rsquo;s Persian campaign,
  and the subsequent formation of the Diadochi&rsquo;s kingdoms provided a
  strong impetus for the further development of these trends. The Thracian
  elites of the time, who were in political and marriage relationships with the
  Macedonian ruling class, actively participated in the propagation of art that
  aimed to glorify particular rulers&rsquo; authority. At the same time,
  Thracian funeral art had its peculiarities that derived from Thracian
  eschatological ideas, local customs, and traditional cultural relations with
  Anatolia and Greece.
